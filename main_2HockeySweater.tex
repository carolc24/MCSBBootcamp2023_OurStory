\maketitle

A change from Ren Li.
The winters of my childhood were long, long seasons.

We all wore the same uniform as Irwin Rose: 
a normal lab coat.
We all combed our hair in the same style as Irwin Rose, 
which was easy because he had very little hair.
We vortexed our samples like Maurice Richard.
We popped off our pipette tips like Maurice Richard.
We cut all his pictures out of the newspapers and pasted them into an MS Paint collage.

We all wore the same uniform as Maurive Richard: 
the red and white uniforms of the Detroit Red Wings, the best hockey team in the world.
We all combed our hair in the same style as Maurice Richard, 
and kept it in place with a sort of glue --- a great deal of glue.
We laced our skates like Maurice Richard.
We taped our sticks like Maurice Richard.
We cut all his pictures out of the newspapers.


In the lab, when we had our time on the microscope, the students would fight each other for their chance to use it.
We were five Irwin Roses taking it away from five other Irwin Roses.
We were ten grad students, all of us wearing, with the same blazing enthusiasm, the uniform of the UCI Anteaters (a lab coat).
On our backs, we all wore no symbols, because embroidery can only be approved by EH&S.
